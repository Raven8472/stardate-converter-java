# Stardate Converter (Java)

A simple Java application that converts standard Earth dates into **Star Trek–style stardates**, inspired by the formatting used in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Voyager.

This project demonstrates basic Java skills including date handling, arithmetic calculations, user input, and console output. It was built as part of my software development practice and coursework.

## 🚀 Features
- Converts a `YYYY-MM-DD` date into an approximate stardate.
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to run from the command line.
- Fully self-contained Java source file.
- Demonstrates clean code structure and basic Java class design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java 17+**
- **VS Code** with Git + GitHub
- **GitHub Copilot** assisted coding
